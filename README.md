Gonna try and collect all the various scripts I've made into one place because this is getting a bit ridiculous. Everything here is more proof of concept than useable - never use these in a production setting without confirming for yourself it won't cause issues.

#### Byond ###
Scripts tied to the BYOND game engine

#### EXO ###
Scripts tied to Exchange Online

#### Fun ###
Time-wasters, mostly stuff made to explain things to others

#### Graph ###
Microsoft Graph centric scripts

#### MDMTools ###
Tools related to MDM in general, Intune in particular

#### SPO ###
Scripts tied to Sharepoint (Get CSOM before running these, they pretty much all need it)

#### Utility ###
Useful but hard to classify, mostly generic useful

#### WinServer ###
Scripts tied to onprem winserver, like AD DS or Exchange
