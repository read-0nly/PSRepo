# Utility #

### BatchJPG ##
Changes all the file extensions in a folder to .jpg

### Compare for Dupes ##
Goes through 2 folders and compares all files, first for name match, then for hash match, and tries to automate clearing out the dupes as much as possible. Defers to user when it's not obvious how to proceed.

### Generic Script Tools ##
Things that are good to have in most scripts. Right now just a quick way to configure powershell to meet module and script requirements before continuing. Gonna have some pre-generated winforms too to make GUI easier to implement, just gotta build the things.

### LogCollector ##
Set the current scenario to the scenario in question, then send as-is to be run on affected device - collects relevant logs for scenario, all in folder on desktop. Easier that asking them to export the logs themselves.

### InterTransmission ##
Transmits text (or a text file) to a window using SendKeys

### Set Wallpaper ##
Maybe this should be under MDMTools, sets the wallpaper of the current user. Gets around the Enterprise requirement of "Set desktop background" in Intune
