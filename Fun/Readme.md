# Fun #

### AnimatedTextExample ##
Absolutely useless, shows an approach to animated text using a refresh loop (mostly as a platform to explain loops to a friend)

### MeteorGame ##
Started out to explain some programming concepts to a friend, but it ended up actually being kinda fun so I kept working on it.
Shoot the meteors, don't let a single one slip past you and don't get hit.
